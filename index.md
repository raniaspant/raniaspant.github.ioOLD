I've been programming for several years now, hence I have lots of projects and small ideas to showcase. My interests tend to shift from 
one programming language to another every now and then.

* [Board simulation using pipes](https://github.com/raniaspant/BoardSimulation)
This was a project that I developed for my Unix Systems Programming (undergraduate studies). Usage of fork/exec for processes, communication between them with pipes/named-pipes, low level I/O, signal management, bash script creation. All of these in combination of custom data structures and dynamic memory management.
Two entities: board client and board server. The server remains active throughout the procedure. The client(s) post on the board on different channels (provided by the server). Server and clients communicate through named pipes. There was also a bash script created to gather statistics about this whole project running (how many boards are running, how many are inactive etc).
