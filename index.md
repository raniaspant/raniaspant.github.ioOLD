I've been programming for several years now, hence I have lots of projects and small ideas to showcase. My interests tend to shift from

Click on the sections above to view my work among with a summary of every project I have done. 

If ~~for some inexplicable reason~~ you want to learn more about me, click on the _About me_ section!
