I've been programming for several years now, hence I have lots of projects and small ideas to showcase. My interests tend to shift from 
one programming language to another every now and then. 

My main focus nowadays is mostly Unity3d (i.e. C#) and Neural Network (i.e. Python). However there is also a C tab above as you may notice. Well, you never forget where you started from, and the C programming language has been my programming starting point. Well, technically Pascal was the first programming language I ever studied, but C was the one that offered me the most.
